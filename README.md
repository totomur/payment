# 🚀 Predictive Model for B2B Collections  

## 📌 Overview  
This project implements a **predictive model using LightGBM** to optimize B2B collections.  
The model is designed to **reduce uncollectible accounts** by identifying high-risk clients  
and improving collection strategies.  

## ✨ Key Features  

✅ **Machine Learning Pipeline** – Structured into **multiple modules** for better readability and maintainability.  

📊 **Feature Engineering** – Incorporates **key financial and behavioral indicators** to enhance predictive power.  

🎯 **Bayesian Optimization** – Fine-tunes **LightGBM hyperparameters** for optimal performance.  

📈 **Performance Metrics** – Evaluated using **precision, recall, and AUC** to ensure robustness.
